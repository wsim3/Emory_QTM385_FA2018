        "In this Pandas Project, I am going to be exploring whether STEM majors earn more money than other majors. I am a senior pursuing BS degree in Quantitative Sciences, one of the STEM majors at Emory, and I recently have seen a trend that many students at Emory, including my close friends, especially international students, pursue STEM majors. The reason behind this is that STEM majors earn more money than non-specialized majors on average, they are more likely to be employed since it is very complex, technical, and time-consuming at work, and for international students holding STEM degree are qualified to receive longer years of Optional Practical Training."

I chose to define STEM majors as specialized and technical majors, such as science and engineering related majors. Also, though not a classical STEM field, the field of Architecture encompasses all aspects of STEM, which are science, technology, engineering and math, with an element of art and design thrown in. In addition to that I will be creating data frame of ten friends of mine who are currently working in the U.S and see whether their salaries are higher or lower than the starting median salary by major with bar graph."

        "As shown above, 5 out of 10 interviewees' starting salaries that I have collected show the similar numbers with the starting median salarie collected by The Wall Street Journal. Among these 5 samples, students who graduated with Accounting, Architecture, Chemical Engineering, Civil Engineering, Computer Science, and Finance earn more than the non-STEM major's (Business, Communications, Economics, and Psychology) starting median salary.\n",
        "\n",
        "From this data, what I have realized from this experiment is that what matters in terms of higher salary is a degree from STEM fields rather than the the other majors. STEM majors are considered as complex and hard fields, and most people aren't willing to perform more time-consuming work, so employers have to pay more to convince enough people to do it. From the Wall Street Journal dataset, I found that Physician assistant, computer enginnering, and chemical engineering degrees, which are of course, STEM majors, are top three degrees that paid off the most while computer science, civil engineering, and finance are top three degrees out of my interviewee samples that paid off the most. In conclusion, a diploma from a highly technical studies could mean higher pay in certain fields of career.\n",
        "\n",
        "While the experiment has been conducted with two datasets collected to see whether STEM majors earn more than starting median salary by other major, there are some limitations to the results obtained. Firstly, unlike my expectation, civil engineering, though known as the one of the most complex STEM degree, doesn't get paid off as much as chemical engineering and computer sciences. And it is dangerous to define that non-STEM majors earn less; my interviewees are all on their first year of working and salaries may vary by the workers' job title. Lastly, the fact that I have only collectd 10 samples of my friends and compare them to the starting median salary by each major may bring out biases due to small sample size, and most of the interviewees hold STEM degrees. If this were to be proper study, I would have collected data of bigger sample sizes and more non-STEM degree holders samples and compare them to the actual dataset of salaries by major."
